It is not a sprint.  
It is not a marathon.  
It is an infinite relay race.  
And the score does not care who ran the fastest.  
Itâ€™s about passing your work to those who can continue it.   
Pass it to those who can push it further.  
To those who can make sure we continue in the game.  
To those who make us less wrong about the game.  
Keep playing for as long as you can improve the quality of our ignorance.  
Pass it on to the next one.
