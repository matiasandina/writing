You did not choose your name, not the first one that was given to you anyway. You did not choose your country of birth. You did not choose your mother tongue. 
You did not choose your face. You didn't choose your skin tone. You didn't choose the educations others will receive.
the way you speak, the your vocal cords. You can always choose to fake it. People will chose for themselves to trust what you say.

You cannot appease everybody. You cannot please everybody 


## The things that you can choose


But maybe you could choose how to react the next time you face somebody that irks you, somebody who rubs you the wrong way.

Maybe you can learn a new language and visit another country. Talk to people that don't share your same values. Ask them to explain themselves. If they don't make sense, ask them to explain further, like a five year old would need. 

What will you choose?
