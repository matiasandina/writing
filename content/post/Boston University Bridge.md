It's sound and sight.  
It's shore and sky.  
It's that little push, the one you need to go on.   
It's a firework burst. Flame on.  

It's the moment of peace when you look afar.   
It's the runners and bikers, and those who age in a car.   
It's the story of our lives, of million eyes and ears alike.   

It's the wills and powers that distress us all.  
And the smiles of the youth and the old.  
It's the dreams of improving the world.  
And the sweat and the tears, and the road rage roar.
