It's 8:23. I could catch the 57 bus in exactly 3 minutes. But, could I make the connection over the bridge?  
Dubious. Maybe the B line, 4 minutes away. No, I hate the B line, how I wish it was a real subway.
Besides, going for the B means forgoing all other options. She said I was afraid to move somewhere together. It would definitely be cheaper rent. Should I be thinking about rent? Too late. Should I move with her? To move is to commit. I guess it's gonna be winter walking again.
