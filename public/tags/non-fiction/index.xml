      <description>They will give you cancer. If you ask, they will lie about it. They will lie about it for 50 years. After that, they will awake to a new consciousness, a fresh peaceful self.

From now on, they will only sell you nicotine in a different shape, one that is appealing to new generation of kids that were not going to be addicts in the first place.</description>

      <description>You did not choose your name, not the first one, that one was given to you. You did not choose your country of birth or the soil that you were taught to call home.
You did not choose your face, the weird wrinkle that defines you. You didn&amp;rsquo;t choose your skin tone, nor whatever other people will think about it.
You didn&amp;rsquo;t choose your mother tongue. You didn&amp;rsquo;t choose the way you speak, your vocal cords, your unconscious cadence.</description>
