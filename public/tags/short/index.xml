      <description>It is not a sprint.
It is not a marathon.
It is an infinite relay race.
And the score does not care who ran the fastest.
Itâ€™s about passing your work to those who can continue it.
Pass it to those who can push it further.
To those who can make sure we continue in the game.
To those who make us less wrong about the game.
Keep playing for as long as you can improve the quality of our ignorance.</description>

      <description>After that thought settled, she realized she would never see the world the same way again. She realized there was no going back after Lasik. Her eyesight was gone forever. The world was pitch black and quiet. She didn&amp;rsquo;t really know where she was, she had the feeling of being seated, though she couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell for sure. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t deaf but the silence was more disturbing than the lack of vision.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s sound and sight.
It&amp;rsquo;s shore and sky.
It&amp;rsquo;s that little push, the one you need to go on.
It&amp;rsquo;s a firework burst. Flame on.
It&amp;rsquo;s the moment of peace when you look afar.
It&amp;rsquo;s the runners and bikers, and those who age in a car.
It&amp;rsquo;s the story of our lives, of million eyes and ears alike.
It&amp;rsquo;s the wills and powers that distress us all.
And the smiles of the youth and the old.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 8:23. I could catch the 57 bus in exactly 3 minutes. But, could I make the connection over the bridge?
Dubious. Maybe the B line, 4 minutes away. No, I hate the B line, how I wish it was a real subway. Besides, going for the B means forgoing all other options. She said I was afraid to move somewhere together. It would definitely be cheaper rent. Should I be thinking about rent?</description>
